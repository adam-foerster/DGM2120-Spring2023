        <h2> Who are we</h2>
            <p>My name is Adam, and ever since I became an adult, I found it ever more difficult to have simple, and healthy meals throughout the day. This made it hard for me to loose weight, and be happy. With that in mind, enjoy looking a lot of the recipies that have helped me throughout my adult life plus some that others have submitted as well. </p>
